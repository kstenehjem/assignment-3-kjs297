- I am a first year PhD student in the department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology.

- I am interested in studying how sleep ecology affects body color evolution.

- I like using phylogenetic comparative methods for finding broad patterns across taxa. On the other hand, I love field work for answering questions at a finer scale.
